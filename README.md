CDJ Merge is an open-source tool for extracting and merging cue points, wave display data and loop points stored by the discontinued [Pioneer CDJ-1000 MK3](http://www.pioneer.eu/uk/products/archive/CDJ-1000%20MK3/index.html) digital CD deck.

## Project Status
May 2011: This project is currently in pre-development status. Begun reverse-engineering proprietary format (see [File Format Info](https://github.com/rdingwall/cdjmerge/wiki/CDJ-1000MK3-SD-Card-File-Format-Info)).

Development will probably be in C (or Python?) and as a command-line or very simple GUI tool. Source code will be on github.

## Get Involved
We need help! Our first challenge is figuring out the [structure of the .PDJ](https://github.com/rdingwall/cdjmerge/wiki/CDJ-1000MK3-SD-Card-File-Format-Info) files used by the CDJ-1000 MK3s. If you own a CDJ-1000 MK3, you can help by grabbing a [hex editor](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10426/what-is-a-good-windows-hex-editor-viewer), learn [how to reverse engineer a file format](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Reverse_Engineering/File_Formats), and post your findings up on the [file format info](https://github.com/rdingwall/cdjmerge/wiki/CDJ-1000MK3-SD-Card-File-Format-Info) wiki page!
